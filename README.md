# about project-files-demonstration
 This repository contains a set of project files for web projects.
 The code is hosted on GitHub Pages here:

# next steps for project development
When implementing a project with file sets like these, I recommend including a README file like the one right here to display the project title and a little information about the project. Some example potential things to include in such a project are below. (And it is always good to include the URL to your live, deployed project site for easy access!)

PROJECT TITLE
by  
(name/byline)

About the Project

(short summary / abstract / description of the project)

Add the URL Link to the live project site</a> for easy access right from the code files and ReadMe.
